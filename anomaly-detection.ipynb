    "The next section contains an implementation of the loss function called \"Additive Angular Margin Loss\", which is a loss function designed to create feature embeddings in a space of a target size. It does this by forcing output embeddings of a certain class to be *closer* in euclidean space, all while forcing embeddings of different classes to be farther apart. It does this along the surface of a hypersphere, with dimensions equal to the number of embedding dimensions (output dimensionality). For more details, please see the Acknowledgements section of the README, which contains a reference to ArcFace, the paper that introduces this loss function."
